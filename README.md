<h1> About Me<h1>

My name is Ann Wilson. I have worked as a fraud analyst for about four years, but have a background in equities trading and consumer banking. I am looking to learn more about fintech to attempt to merge my customer experience with the technical side of fraud protection.

This is my family. I think of them when I do my work, striving to protct other families like them.
